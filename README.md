To control the process of charging and discharging of Lithium ion or LiPo batteries, they will stop working or worse. The battery cells can swell and even explode from overcharging, and a deep discharge can make the battery fail. Thatâ€™s why these batteries should go together with a battery management system unit or BMS.
