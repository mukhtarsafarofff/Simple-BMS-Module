To control the process of charging and discharging of Lithium ion or LiPo batteries, they will stop working or worse. The battery cells can swell and even explode from overcharging, and a deep discharge can make the battery fail. That’s why these batteries should go together with a battery management system unit or BMS. This will control the voltage and current from the battery and keep them safe. The nominal voltage of a LIPO battery is 3.8 volts and 4.2V when fully charged. As soon as the battery cell will reach this value, the charging process should stop and that’s what this circuit should do.
