To control the process of charging and discharging of Lithium ion or LiPo batteries, they will stop working or worse. The battery cells can swell and even explode from overcharging, and a deep discharge can make the battery fail. That’s why these batteries should go together with a battery management system unit or BMS. This will control the voltage and current from the battery and keep them safe. The nominal voltage of a LIPO battery is 3.8 volts and 4.2V when fully charged. As soon as the battery cell will reach this value, the charging process should stop and that’s what this circuit should do. When we have only one cell, we only care about the maximum voltage and the current limit to protect the battery. But when we have a battery pack of more than 1 cell, so 2S, 3S and so on, we also need to balance the value of each individual cell.
